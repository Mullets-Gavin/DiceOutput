Output Roblox logs into the chat! Let players in your test game view the chat & send you screenshot errors so you can quickly debug what's wrong and not need to worry about if the player can't use the F9 console properly. This also outputs the server into the chat, allowing you to keep a test place open & your players can report back if the server had an error! This outputs `warns (orange)`, `prints (blue)`, and `errors (red)` into the chat.
